- Create a php program that handles class "acme" that represents files and folders. The main objects are files & folders.


  * Implement interface for file listing of files and folders (listing a folder will list items in it)
  * Implement interfaces for delete method between files & folder. The delete for folder will delete recursively (implementation should be recursive for this delete).


  * Create exception for nonexistence of a file/folder, permission.
  * Create unit test to handle delete and file listing.


- Create a class hierarchy involving:


  * Jewelry with children of ring, necklace and bracelete.
  * Create attributes size, weight, price, color.

  * Implement method "wash" on each kind of object (ring, necklace & bracelete). The "wash" method would be different on each one.  


- Create a php program that would do the following:


  * Start transaction
  * End transaction

- Create a php unit test using the code above that correctly handles a rollback situation and successful transaction (positive & negative tests).
